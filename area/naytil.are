Up a tree~
After climbing up the small wobbly planks nailed on this tree by a little
hand you wonder how come an OSHA safety commitee has not condemned it.
The view up here is spectacular allowing you to view the roaring waterfall
and the gorgeous meadows that stretch out below you.  The wonder of nature
and magic mixed leave you feeling peaceful and serene.
Above you is a small trap door.
Below you are wobbly boards nailed into the tree to form a ladder.

The trolls den~
The filth and the smell has gotten real bad in this area.  All the worst 
things you can believe in have been tied up and spread out over this room.
Such filth makes is impossible and unsafe to search.  You have never been 
in such a filthy place in your life.  Bones, guts, smashed bits of armor.
It is amazing that the paladins never found this place in their time at
Naytil.

Hallway of mushrooms~
This hallway is full of various fungi.  Unfortunatly none of it is good to
eat. The poison of all these mushrooms is so potent that you can smell it
in the air.  The stench of the rot of the fungi and the animals that have
fallen for it makes this room as unbearable as the rest of the joint.

In the shaft~
The breeze in the shaft starts to flush the smell of rot and death out of 
your nose.  You dread the thought of having to go back down to leave this
place and pray that the breeze means and exit ahead.

the mossy tunnel~
This mossy tunnel has the huge tracks in it heading both ways, there are
also a few deer and rabbit bones strewn about, but generally it is a 
pleasant sight from what you saw below.  You hope never to have to go
down to face that mess again.

mossy tunnel mouth~
You are at the end of a tunnel looking to the south.  You are standing on a
12 foot drop off that leads into a deep thick green forest.  You do not see
an easy way down except for the southern drop.
